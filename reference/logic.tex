\section*{Preliminaries}

\subsection*{Arguments}

A \defn{sentence} is a statement that could in principle be true or
false. (It is not, for example, a question or an interjection.) The book
says that ``a \textsc{sentence} [is] a sentence that can be true or
false'' which seems circular. On the other hand, I have not defined a
``statement.''

An \defn{argument} is a finite sequence of sentences. The final sentence is called the \defn{conclusion}; the other sentences are called the \defn{premises}. 

A \defn{counterexample} to an argument is a situation in which all the
premises are true but the conclusion is false. An argument is
\defn{valid} if it has no counterexamples. Thus, an argument is valid
if, whenever the premises are all true, then necessarily the conclusion
is true. An argument that is not valid is \defn{invalid}.

If it is not possible for a sentence to be false, it is
\defn{necessarily true}. For example: ``The number 7 is either odd or
even.'' If it is not possible for a sentence to be true, it is
\defn{necessarily false}. A sentence that is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false is called \defn{contingent}.

Two sentences are \defn{jointly equivalent} if in all cases either they are both true or they are both false. A set of sentences are \defn{jointly possible} if there is a case in which they are all true; sentences that are not not jointly possible are \defn{jointly impossible}.

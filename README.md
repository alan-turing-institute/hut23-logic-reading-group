# hut23-logic-reading-group

Materials for a logic study group.

### Reading materials

At present, our text is [_forall x:
Calgary_](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/), a free and open source
textbook.

Other things that look interesting are:

- [_Carnap_](https://carnap.io/book) is an online, introductory book with
  interactive exercises: the website checks your proofs.
- [Logical
  Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/toc.html),
  is Volume 1 of _Software foundations_, an extremely comprehensive
  overview of the mathematical foundations of reliable software.

### Schedule

We meet on Thursdays at noon, usually in David Blackwell (but the
first week is in Marian Rejewski).

Discussions occur on Slack in the
(misnamed!) `hut23-linear-algebra-reading-group` channel.
